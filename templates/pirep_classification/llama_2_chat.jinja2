<s> [INST] <<SYS>> A pilot report (PIREP) in air traffic control radio communications is a pilot report of in-flight weather (e.g. “rain”, “snow”, “fog”), sky conditions (e.g. “scattered”, “clear”), wind conditions (e.g., "wind calm", "wind calm"), atmospheric conditions (e.g. “outside temperature minus seven”, “severe icing"), and/or flight conditions (e.g. “smooth ride”, “moderate intermittent chop”).
Radio transmissions that are not a PIREP:
- Questions about a PIREP
- Requests for a PIREP
- Controller statements reiterating past PIREPs to answer a pilot's question
- Airspace fix names that are homophones to weather terms, e.g. haze
Classify a transcript as 1 or 0, where 1 means the transcript contains a PIREP and 0 means the transcript does not contain a PIREP. Do not provide an explanation for your classifications. <</SYS>>
