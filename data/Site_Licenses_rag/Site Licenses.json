            "query": "What considerations are important for selecting a launch site?",
            "context": "When selecting a launch site, several considerations are crucial to ensure safety and operational efficiency. These include geographical location, which affects the trajectory and potential impact zones; proximity to populated areas, which must be minimized to reduce risk; and environmental factors, such as weather patterns and natural hazards. Additionally, logistical support, including access to transportation and communication infrastructure, is essential. Regulatory compliance with local, state, and federal laws is also a key factor in the site selection process.",
            "answer": "Geographical location, proximity to populated areas, environmental factors, logistical support, and regulatory compliance."

            "query": "How can launch vehicle operators improve telemetry data accuracy?",
            "context": "Improving telemetry data accuracy is vital for the successful monitoring and control of launch vehicles. Operators can enhance accuracy by using high-quality sensors and ensuring proper calibration before each launch. Implementing redundant systems can help verify data integrity and identify discrepancies. Additionally, operators should employ advanced data processing algorithms to filter out noise and improve signal clarity. Regular maintenance and testing of telemetry equipment are also essential to ensure reliable performance during launch operations.",
            "answer": "Use high-quality sensors, implement redundant systems, employ advanced algorithms, and conduct regular maintenance."
