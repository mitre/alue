THE PROBLEM STARTED AROUND 1400Z OR SO WHEN DAL DEPARTURES GOT SLOWED DOWN TO A NEAR DEPARTURE STOP. THE DAL SURFACE STARTED BACKING UP. INITIALLY IT WAS JUST SOUTH GATE DEPARTURES, BUT EVEN AS THE SOUTH GATE RE-OPENED WE WERE NOT SEEING ANY DEPARTURES OFF OF DAL. AS THE SURFACE STARTED TO BACK UP, WE STARTED TO COMMUNICATE WITH ZFW AND D10 ABOUT GETTING SOME FLIGHTS OVER 60 MINUTES MOVING AND WE WERE ABLE TO GET TWO OF THOSE FLIGHTS AIRBORNE. SOON AFTER, DAL DEPARTURES SLOWED TO CRAWL WHILE DFW FLIGHTS WERE FLOWING AT A GOOD RATE. BY 1550Z, DAL WAS BACKED UP WITH SEVERAL FLIGHT GOING +60. AFTER ANOTHER ROUND OF PHONE CALLS AROUND 1600Z, WE WERE INFORMED THAT DFW WAS GETTING FAVORED AS \"\"THE DELAY NUMBERS SHOWED DFW AT 75 MINS AND DAL AT 45 MINS.\"\" AT THAT TIME, WE HAD MULTIPLE FLIGHTS OVER 90 MINUTES, SEVERAL FLIGHTS OVER 60 MINUTES, AND AT LEAST A DOZEN MORE THAN 45 MINUTES.

THAT BEING SAID, WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF ZFW, D10 AND DAL TOWER THROUGHOUT THE EVENT. ONCE WE WERE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THAT WE HAD AN ISSUE AT DAL, THE FACILITIES WERE ABLE TO GET DAL FLIGHTS MOVING AND THE DELAY NUMBERS MOVING IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION.
